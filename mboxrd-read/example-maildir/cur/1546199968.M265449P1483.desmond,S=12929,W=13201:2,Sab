Dear John,

John's birthday is just around the corner, and I hope you will be able to join us for a special celebration. On December 11, friends and family will gather in Boston to support John's new grassroots action committee, Keeping America's Promise.

John founded Keeping America's Promise with one goal in mind: build on the foundation and momentum we all created in 2004 and channel it toward strengthening our party and electing Democrats in 2005 and beyond. And that's exactly what he's doing. Keeping America's Promise is supporting Democratic candidates in tough races, standing up for the principles that make our country great, and engaging millions of concerned citizens in the fight for change at the grassroots. 

Click here to RSVP or for more information, or contact Jon Patsavos at jpatsavos@johnkerry.com or 617-263-3389:
https://contribute.keepingamericaspromise.com/events/20051211_Boston.html
And I do hope you'll join us, because we are at a crossroads in America, and we all have a role to play.

If you are unable to attend, I hope you'll support Keeping America's Promise by making a contribution today.

There are daily reminders that the Republicans who run Washington have lost touch with the values and priorities of the American people. Forces outside the mainstream now seem to push Republican leaders effortlessly into abusing power, inserting government into our private lives, injecting religion into debates about public policy, and ignoring real problems that keep American families up at night. We all saw how Hurricane Katrina has exposed not only misplaced priorities but also a terrifying lack of competence.

In the wake of Katrina, millions of Americans are reengaging in our democracy. At Keeping America's Promise, John is inspiring as many Americans as he can to join him in tackling the immense challenges facing our nation. By developing a grassroots organization committed to promoting progressive candidates up and down the ticket across America, John is doing the hard work it takes to elect people willing to make Washington work for Americans again.

I know how much it would mean to John on his birthday to have his friends and supporters join together once again to help him in this important effort. All of the ingredients are in place for Keeping America's Promise to make an incredible impact: organization, leadership, momentum, an unparalleled nationwide network of grassroots activists -- and maybe most importantly -- a nation deeply concerned about this administration's failures and ready for a new direction.

Together, we can help make it possible. We can give voice to our values. And we can lay the groundwork for electoral gains in 2006 that give us the power to bring change to this land. 

On December 11, I hope you'll join us on John's birthday to lend your voice and ideas, and help us raise the resources needed to make Keeping America's Promise a growing success. 
https://contribute.keepingamericaspromise.com/events/20051211_Boston.html

If you cannot attend, I hope you will show your support by making a contribution.

Thank you for your continued support and friendship. I look forward to seeing you for this very special celebration of John's birthday.

With all best wishes for the holidays,

Cam Kerry
